      <h3 class="page-title white-text teal">My Interest in Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW)</h3>
      <div class="container flow-text">

        <p>I am passionate about using developing software products to connect people and have always been curious to learn more about how systems/apps can be designed to improve the way we collaborate today. This is one of the reasons that motivated me to take CSCW (i.e., CSCE-672.600) in Fall 2022 at Texas A&M University.</p>
        <p>More specifically, by taking this class, I look forward to learning more about how we use technology to collaborate and important factors/metrics that determine the success of a software product, particularly in the context of communication and collaboration.</p>

    <!-- Fourth Section: My opinion on features of Collaborative Software Tools help me the most with regards to working with others -->
    <section id="my-opinion-important-features-in-collaborative-software-tools" class="section scrollspy">
      <h3 class="page-title white-text teal">What features of these Software Tools do I think help me the most with regards to working with others?</h3>
      <div class="container flow-text">

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>-> <i>Simple to Use (UI):</i></strong> A majority of the software tools that I mentioned previously have functionalities that are relatively easy to learn - using these tools, one can be conveniently share information with others <i>instantly</i> or collaborate with others.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>-> <i>Version Tracking:</i></strong> Modifying documents on Google Drive, iCloud, GitHub, or GoodNotes allows us to track changes made by each user. This also makes it easy to roll-back to a previous version (that is stable) if necessary.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>-> <i>Being able to communicate and collaborate in real-time:</i></strong> Whether it is being able to view changes made to documents by others in real-time (i.e., on Google Drive or on iCloud) or being able to send messages instantly to each other or being able to jump onto a video call right away, software products (i.e., mentioned previously) make it easier to work together on documents and discuss problems/solutions/ideas. Additionally, such softwares made it possible for majority of us to work remotely during COVID; with such softwares, it is now easier to collaborate and communicate with others even if other individuals are living in different corners of the globe (or working in different time zones).</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>-> <i>Sharing Knowledge:</i></strong> Software Platforms such as Quora and Reddit allow individuals to both share and gain knowledge for free. Furthermore, it allows users to ask follow-up questions or share their thoughts by adding comments to answers that have been submitted by other users; also users have the ability to show their support for an answer they agree with or found helpful by upvoting answers (or comments) submitted by other users, which helps one determine the credibility of an answer they are unsure of.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>-> <i>Connecting with others:</i></strong> Social Media Platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram has made it easier for us to connect with others. Another example is having the ability to have food or a package delivered to your door through Software apps such as UberEats or Amazon.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

    <!-- Fifth Section: How I think Collaborative Software Tools can be improved -->
    <section id="how-i-think-collaborative-software-tools-can-be-improved" class="section scrollspy">
      <h3 class="page-title white-text teal">How I think Collaborative Software Tools can be improved?</h3>
      <div class="container flow-text">

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>-></strong> Most of these softwares are expensive to develop and maintain. Also, these softwares require storing data on cloud servers, which is expensive. As a result, most of the organizations require the end-user to purchase a license in order to use a particular software product. Not all individuals or organizations (especially startups) have the resources to spend on such tools and hence are unable to utilize them. On the other hand, some organizations do not require the user to purchase a license and generate revenue through ads, which ruins the user experience (i.e., makes it difficult to collaborate using the software product).</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>-></strong> Software applications such as WhatsApp or GroupMe (messaging app) store confidential messages. Not all messaging or video call applications provide end-to-end encryption or indicate how an individual's data is kept private. Another example would be social media applications (such as Facebook or Instagram) collecting an individual's conversation to generate targeted ads. It is imperative that all collaborative softwares are more transparent on the kind of data that is being collected and how it is being utilized.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>-></strong> Today, we use softwares maintained by several organizations and each organization follows a slightly different approach towards creating the UI (i.e., user interface). This makes it difficult for people who are not tech-savvy - they need to invest time to understand the software's functionalities and accessibility features. For example, one can agree that Android and iOS OS (i.e., operating system) have a significantly different UI. Also, UI keeps on changing with software updates, making it more difficult for such individuals to keep up.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>-></strong> These softwares require users to explicitly and regularly provide information about themselves, which could otherwise be automated. For instance, providing one's availability on Slack or Microsoft Teams.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>-></strong> Not all softwares support accessibility for disabled individuals. And even those that do require individuals with disabilities to invest a significant portion of their time to be able to collaborate with others using these tools. Given that 12.7% of the US population is physically disabled, it is critical that we design such collaborative software tools that allows all individuals (regardless of their disability) to collaborate.</li>
          </ul>
